  Projects in Android Studio are much more straightforward to program when TF Lite models are pre-loaded with image classification. This project will train an ImageNet model from scratch using the .ipnyb model provided, then can be loaded to any code editor and trained using the metadata_writer_for_image_classifier.py file.
  A pretrained .tflite model is provided in the without_metadata directory as a sample, however any model and .txt file works provided the metadata_writer_for_image_classifier.py file is modified as specified based on what image classification is provided. Refer to [https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/convert/metadata](url) on further info on loading metadata onto tensoflow lite models.
